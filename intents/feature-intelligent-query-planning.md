# Feature Intent: Intelligent Query Planning System

## Overview
Develop an advanced query planning system that enables the LLM to dynamically create and execute multi-step query strategies to provide comprehensive, high-quality responses to complex user questions about organizational intelligence.

## Problem Statement
The current Meeting Intelligence Service, while powerful, has limitations in handling complex queries that require multiple data sources, iterative analysis, or strategic thinking. Users often ask questions that need:

Transform the LLM from a single-query processor into an intelligent query strategist that can:
1. Analyze complex user questions
2. Develop multi-step query strategies
3. Execute queries iteratively
4. Analyze intermediate results
5. Perform follow-up queries as needed
6. Synthesize comprehensive final responses
