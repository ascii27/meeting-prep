# Document Processing Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the approach for adding document processing capabilities to the Meeting Prep Assistant application. The feature will focus on fetching and processing Google Docs associated with calendar events, as specified in the PRD under "Document Processing" (Key Feature #2). Based on current requirements, we will only fetch documents when a meeting card is clicked.

## Branch
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/document-processing`

## Status
- **Implementation Status**: Completed
- **Testing Status**: Unit tests implemented

## Objectives
1. ✅ Implement Google Docs API integration to fetch document content
2. ✅ Create a document service to handle document operations
3. ✅ Update the UI to allow users to view associated documents when clicking on a calendar event
4. ✅ Implement document processing utilities for text extraction and preparation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Google Docs API Integration ✅
- ✅ Verified necessary Google Docs API scopes in OAuth configuration
- ✅ Implemented Google Docs API client setup in the document service
- ✅ Created functions to fetch document metadata and content
- ✅ Handled authentication and authorization for document access
- ✅ Added error handling for API failures

### 2. Document Service Creation ✅
- ✅ Created `documentService.js` with the following functions:
  - ✅ `getDocumentById(documentId, tokens)`: Fetches a Google Doc by its ID
  - ✅ `getDocumentsForEvent(event, tokens)`: Gets documents associated with a specific event by examining attachments
  - ✅ `extractDocumentContent(document)`: Extracts and formats content from a document
- ✅ Implemented caching for document content to improve performance

### 3. Document Processing ✅
- ✅ Implemented functions to identify Google Drive attachments in calendar events
  - ✅ Looking for attachments with Google Doc MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.document`
  - ✅ Extracting document IDs from attachment URLs
- ✅ Created utilities to parse and format document content for display
- ✅ Added helper functions to identify document types and handle them appropriately

### 4. UI Updates ✅
- ✅ Enhanced meeting cards with data-event-id attribute for document fetching
- ✅ Added a document section to the expanded meeting view
- ✅ Created a document display panel within the meeting card for showing document content
- ✅ Added document preview functionality with back navigation

### 5. Route Updates ✅
- ✅ Created new API routes for document operations:
  - ✅ `GET /api/documents/:documentId`: Fetches a specific document
  - ✅ `GET /api/events/:eventId/documents`: Gets documents for an event
- ✅ Updated dashboard route to store events in session for document API access

### 6. Testing ✅
- ✅ Created unit tests for document service functions
  - ✅ Tests for getDocumentById
  - ✅ Tests for getDocumentsForEvent
  - ✅ Tests for extractDocumentContent
- ✅ Added tests for error handling and edge cases

### 7. Documentation ✅
- ✅ Updated implementation plan to reflect completed work
- ✅ Added code comments for document service functions and API routes
- ✅ Documented the document processing flow in the implementation plan

## Dependencies
- ✅ Google Docs API client library (via googleapis package)
- ✅ Google Calendar API for accessing event attachments
- ✅ Document content formatting utilities (implemented in documentService.js)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Users can view documents associated with calendar events when clicking on a meeting card
2. ✅ Document content is properly fetched and displayed
3. ✅ All document operations have appropriate error handling
4. ✅ Unit tests pass with good coverage

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features
1. **Document Service**: Created a service to fetch and process Google Docs
   - Extracts documents from event attachments
   - Fetches document content via Google Docs API
   - Formats document content for display

2. **API Routes**: Added routes for document operations
   - `/api/events/:eventId/documents`: Gets documents for an event
   - `/api/documents/:documentId`: Fetches a specific document's content

3. **UI Integration**: Enhanced the dashboard UI
   - Added document section to meeting cards
   - Implemented document list and content display
   - Added navigation between document list and content views

4. **Testing**: Created unit tests for the document service

### Technical Implementation Details
- Documents are fetched only when a meeting card is clicked to optimize performance
- Events are stored in the session for the document API to access
- Document content is cached to reduce API calls
- Error handling is implemented throughout the document processing flow

### Future Enhancements
- Add integration tests for document API routes
- Implement manual document association feature
- Add HTML parsing for document links in event descriptions
- Improve document content formatting with rich text support
