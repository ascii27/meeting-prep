# AI-Powered Meeting Preparation - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This feature will enhance the Meeting Prep Assistant by adding AI-powered analysis of meeting documents to generate concise summaries, identify key topics, and provide preparation suggestions for users. The implementation will leverage OpenAI's API to analyze documents associated with calendar events and present the results in a user-friendly format.

## Technical Approach

### 1. OpenAI Integration
- Set up OpenAI API integration with appropriate authentication
- Create a service for handling API requests to OpenAI
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- Configure appropriate models and parameters for document analysis

### 2. Document Analysis Service
- Create a new service to extract and prepare text from Google Docs for AI analysis
- Implement document chunking for handling large documents
- Design prompts for different analysis types (summary, key topics, action items)
- Develop caching mechanisms to avoid redundant API calls

### 3. Meeting Preparation Logic
- Create a service to coordinate document retrieval, AI analysis, and result formatting
- Implement logic to determine when to trigger automatic analysis
- Design algorithms for merging insights from multiple documents
- Add functionality to detect and highlight changes in recurring meetings

### 4. API Routes
- Create new API endpoints for:
  - Generating meeting summaries
  - Retrieving preparation suggestions
  - Manually triggering re-analysis
  - Saving user notes alongside AI-generated content

### 5. UI Enhancements
- Update meeting detail view to display AI-generated content
- Add UI components for summaries, key topics, and preparation suggestions
- Implement loading states and error handling in the UI
- Create intuitive navigation between different types of meeting preparation content

### 6. In-Memory Caching
- Implement in-memory caching for AI-generated meeting preparations
- Create cache structure for:
  - Meeting summaries
  - Key topics
  - Preparation suggestions
  - User notes
- Set up cache invalidation strategy for data freshness

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation and OpenAI Integration
1. Set up OpenAI API client and authentication
2. Create basic document analysis service with prompt engineering
3. Implement test endpoints for AI analysis
4. Add error handling and rate limiting

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Enhance document processing to prepare text for AI analysis
2. Implement meeting preparation service
3. Create API routes for meeting preparation
4. Add basic UI components for displaying AI-generated content
5. Implement caching and optimization

### Phase 3: UI and User Experience
1. Enhance UI with improved formatting of AI-generated content
2. Add user interaction features (manual triggers, feedback)
3. Implement user notes functionality
4. Create loading states and error handling in UI

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. Write unit tests for AI services and endpoints
2. Conduct integration testing
3. Optimize prompts based on result quality
4. Refine UI based on usability testing

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- OpenAI Node.js client library
- Text processing utilities for document preparation
- In-memory caching utilities (e.g., node-cache)

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for OpenAI services
- `OPENAI_MODEL` - Model to use for analysis (e.g., "gpt-4")
- `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` - Maximum tokens for API responses
- `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` - Temperature setting for response generation

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/meetings/:meetingId/preparation
- Retrieves AI-generated preparation materials for a specific meeting
- Returns summary, key topics, and preparation suggestions

#### POST /api/meetings/:meetingId/analyze
- Manually triggers AI analysis for a meeting
- Accepts optional parameters to customize analysis

#### POST /api/meetings/:meetingId/notes
- Saves user notes alongside AI-generated content
- Associates notes with specific meetings

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of OpenAI API keys
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
- Sanitization of document content before sending to OpenAI
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Secure handling of cached sensitive meeting data

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for AI service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Prompt testing with various document types
- Performance testing for large documents

## Future Enhancements
- Personalized preparation suggestions based on user role
- Historical analysis of recurring meetings
- Integration with meeting notes and action items
- Voice summaries for hands-free preparation
