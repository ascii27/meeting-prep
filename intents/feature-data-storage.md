# Data Storage Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Data Storage feature of the Meeting Prep application, as specified in the PRD. The feature will enable persistent storage of meeting summaries, preparation notes, user preferences, and meeting history.

## Current State
The application currently uses in-memory caching (via node-cache) for storing AI-generated content and document data. This approach doesn't provide persistence across server restarts and lacks the ability to maintain historical data.

## Requirements from PRD
- Store meeting summaries and preparation notes for future reference
- Save user preferences and settings
- Maintain history of past meetings and preparations

## Implementation Approach
Given the PRD's technical requirements specifying PostgreSQL for data storage, we will implement a PostgreSQL database integration while maintaining compatibility with the existing in-memory caching system for performance.

### 1. Database Setup
- Set up PostgreSQL database connection
- Create database schema with tables for:
  - Users
  - Meetings
  - Meeting Summaries
  - Preparation Notes
  - User Preferences

### 2. Data Models
- Define Sequelize models for each database table
- Implement relationships between models (e.g., User has many Meetings)
- Create migration scripts for database setup and updates

### 3. Data Access Layer
- Create repository classes for database operations
- Implement CRUD operations for each model
- Add caching layer to improve performance for frequently accessed data

### 4. API Endpoints
- Add new endpoints for:
  - Saving and retrieving meeting notes
  - Managing user preferences
  - Accessing meeting history
- Update existing endpoints to use the database for persistence

### 5. UI Enhancements
- Add UI components for viewing meeting history
- Implement note-taking functionality in the meeting preparation view
- Create user preferences page
