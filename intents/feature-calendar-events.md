# Calendar Events Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This feature will implement the calendar integration functionality to fetch and display meeting events for the current week (Monday-Friday) from the user's Google Calendar.

## Goals
- Fetch calendar events for the current week
- Display events in a day planner list view
- Show meeting details including title, time, attendees, and preparation status
- Provide a foundation for future document processing features

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Google Calendar API Integration
- Create a calendar service module to handle API interactions
- Implement functions to fetch events for a specified date range
- Handle authentication and token management

### 2. Create Calendar Data Processing Logic
- Define data structures for calendar events
- Implement date range calculation for the current week (Monday-Friday)
- Process raw calendar API responses into application-friendly format
- Extract relevant meeting information (title, time, location, attendees, description)

### 3. Update Routes and Controllers
- Create a new route for fetching calendar events
- Implement controller logic to process requests and responses
- Add error handling for API failures

### 4. Extend Existing UI Design
- Leverage the existing UI design and components
- Extend the dashboard view to include the day planner functionality
- Add meeting card components that match the current design system
- Implement loading states and error handling consistent with the existing UI
- Make minimal modifications to maintain design consistency

### 5. Add User Interaction Features
- Implement day navigation (previous/next week)
- Add meeting detail expansion/collapse functionality
- Create preparation status indicators

### 6. Testing
- Test API integration with various calendar configurations
- Verify correct handling of recurring meetings
- Test edge cases (no events, all-day events, multi-day events)
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

### 7. Documentation
- Update API documentation
- Add comments to code
- Update README with new feature information

## Technical Considerations
- Use proper error handling for API requests
- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Consider rate limiting and quota restrictions from Google Calendar API
- Ensure proper handling of time zones

## Dependencies
- Google Calendar API client library
- Date manipulation library (e.g., date-fns or moment.js)

## Future Enhancements
- Calendar event filtering
- Meeting categorization
- Integration with document processing feature
- Calendar event creation/modification
